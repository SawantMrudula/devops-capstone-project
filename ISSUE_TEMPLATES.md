As a DevOps Developer
I need to automate the deployment process for our web application
So that we can release updates more quickly and with fewer errors  
      
### Details and Assumptions
   * The web application is built using a modern tech stack (e.g., Node.js, React, or Python/Django).
* We have a staging environment for testing changes before production deployment.
* Deployment involves building, testing, and deploying to multiple servers.
     
### Acceptance Criteria     
   Given the code repository is up to date with the latest changes
When I trigger the deployment process
Then the deployment process automates the following steps:
  - Build the application
  - Run automated tests
  - Deploy the application to the staging environment
  - Perform smoke tests in the staging environment
  - If all tests pass, deploy the application to production servers
  - Monitor the production environment for any issues
  - Send a notification upon successful deployment

And in case of any failures during the deployment:
Given the code repository is up to date with the latest changes
When I trigger the deployment process
Then the deployment process halts immediately and notifies the team of the failure
